# Code for manuscript and appendices of Byrnes, J.E.K. and Dee, L.E. 2024. Causal inference with observational data and unobserved confounding variables. Ecology Letters.

- *supporting_information_s6_s7* is R markdown files for both simulations used within the manuscript as well as a guide to implementing the causal methods in the manuscript with a sample data set.

- *supporting_information_s8_app_one_run* provides code for an R Shiny App to explore one simulated run of our temperature-snail system to evaluate the performance of different modeling techniques depending on the data generating process in the system. It is currently running at https://shiny.umb.edu/shiny/users/jarrett.byrnes/shiny_ovb/
  
- *supporting_information_s9_s9_simulations* provides code for an R Shiny App to explore the output from thousands of simulated runs of our temperature-snail system to evaluate the performance of different modeling techniques depending on the data generating process in the system. It is currently running at https://shiny.umb.edu/shiny/users/jarrett.byrnes/ovb_sims/.

- *scripts* provides helper scripts and functions for the supporting information files.  

- *data* provides the sample data set used in Supporting Information S7, the code-through example of techniques.
