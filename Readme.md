# Code for manuscript and appendices of Byrnes, J.E.K. and Dee, L.E. 2024. Causal inference with observational data and unobserved confounding variables.

- *appendix_a_b_markdown* is R markdown files for both simulations used within the manuscript as well as a guide to implementing the causal methods in the manuscript with a sample data set.

- *app_appendix_c_one_run* provides code for an R Shiny App to explore one simulated run of our temperature-snail system to evaluate the performance of different modeling techniques depending on the data generating process in the system. It is currently running at https://shiny.umb.edu/shiny/users/jarrett.byrnes/shiny_ovb/


- *app_appendix_d_simulations* provides code for an R Shiny App to explore the output from thousands of simulated runs of our temperature-snail system to evaluate the performance of different modeling techniques depending on the data generating process in the system. It is currently running at https://shiny.umb.edu/shiny/users/jarrett.byrnes/ovb_sims/. 


- *scripts* provides helper scripts and functions for the appendices.
