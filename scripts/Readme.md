# Helper code files for manuscript and supporting information of Byrnes, J.E.K. and Dee, L.E. 2024. Causal inference with observational data and unobserved confounding variables. Ecology Letters.
  
- *make_ovb_diagram.R* - makes the DAG/path diagram used in the manuscript. This was an initial draft used as the authors explored programatic figure generation.  
  
- *ovb_temp_snail_funs.R* - functions for simulation of the confounded snail system in the manuscript. These have all been put into Supporting Information S6, but this file will enable rapid re-use for anyone wishing to modify simulation conditions within a pure code environment.
